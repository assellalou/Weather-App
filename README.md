[Preview](https://assellalou.github.io/Weather-App/)

Hi! this is a simple **Weather App** based on **FCC WEATHER API** and some **JS** running arround.


# Files :file_folder:

Check the `.assets/css/` for custom styling, I'm using `skycons.js` for the awesome weather icons it provides, you can change that in `./assets/main.js`.
`./assets/img/` I don't really know the owner of these pictures but thanks to him/her.

## Rename a file :pushpin:

if happened that you want to rename a file don't forget to change the paths in `index.html`

## Font :trollface:

I used **`Oxygen`** font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)


> **Note:** use the app freely in whatever purpose you want but don't forget to mention the author's ass :peach:
